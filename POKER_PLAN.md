Building a poker application with varied game types (like PLO, Bomb Pots, and Indian Poker) requires a different architectural approach than a standard CRUD app. In poker, **state consistency** and **information hiding** (preventing cheating) are your biggest challenges.

Here is a breakdown of how Supabase Realtime works in this context and how to architect your game creation.

### 1\. Understanding Supabase Realtime for Poker

Supabase Realtime provides three core features, and you will need all three for a poker site. Think of Supabase as the "Casino Floor" and the Realtime features as the staff:

#### A. Presence (The Floor Manager)

**What it does:** Tracks who is currently "online" and looking at the socket connection.
**Poker Use Case:**

- Showing "Player X is Online/Away" indicators at the table.
- Detecting when a player disconnects unexpectedly (so you can activate their "time bank" or fold their hand).
- **Crucial:** Do not use this for game logic (like "whose turn is it"). Use it only for UI status.

#### B. Postgres Changes (The Dealer's Voice)

**What it does:** Listens to your database. When a row is inserted, updated, or deleted, it instantly pushes that data to the client.
**Poker Use Case:** This is your main game loop.

- **Public Game State:** When the board cards are dealt, the server updates the `games` table. All players subscribing to that game receive the update: `board: ['Ah', 'Kh', 'Td']`.
- **Player Actions:** When a player bets, they don't send a message to other players directly. They insert a row into an `actions` table. The database triggers calculate the new pot size, update the `games` table, and _that_ update is broadcasted to everyone.

#### C. Broadcast (The Table Talk)

**What it does:** Sends ephemeral messages between users without saving to the database. Low latency, but no history.
**Poker Use Case:**

- Cursor tracking (seeing where opponents are looking).
- "Show one card" animations (if you want to show a card after folding without saving it to game history).
- Chat emojis/reactions.

### 2\. How to Handle "Private Information" (Anti-Cheating)

This is the most critical part. **You cannot send everyone's cards to the frontend and just "hide" them with CSS.** Tech-savvy users will open the network tab and see their opponent's cards.

**The Solution: Row Level Security (RLS) with Realtime**
Supabase Realtime respects RLS. This means if you set up your database policies correctly, Player A will _physically not receive_ the data packet containing Player B's cards.

- **Public Table (`games`):** Contains the pot, the board cards (Flop/Turn/River), and the current turn. RLS: `Select` policy allows `True` for everyone in the room.
- **Private Table (`player_hands`):** Contains the hole cards (e.g., `['As', 'Ks']`).
  - **RLS Policy:** `auth.uid() == user_id`.
  - **Result:** When the server deals cards, it inserts rows for every player. Player A's client only receives the "INSERT" event for their own hand. They get _no_ data about Player B's hand.

### 3\. Architecture for "Variations" (Bomb Pots, Indian, etc.)

To support multiple game types (Double Board, 3-Board, etc.) without creating 50 different tables, use a **Flexible Schema** with JSONB columns.

#### Database Schema Design

**1. `tables` (The Rooms)**
Standard configuration for the lobby.

```sql
id: uuid
name: string
game_variant: string (enum: 'holdem', 'plo_bomb_double', 'indian')
config: jsonb  -- { "bomb_pot_every": 30, "boards": 2, "max_players": 6 }
```

**2. `games` (The Current Hand)**
This represents a single "hand" of poker.

```sql
id: uuid
table_id: uuid
status: string ('active', 'showdown', 'complete')
pot: integer
current_player_id: uuid
-- THE MAGIC PART:
board_state: jsonb
```

**How `board_state` handles variations:**

- **Standard Hold'em:** `{"board1": ["Ah", "Kh", "7d"]}`
- **Double Board Bomb Pot:** `{"board1": ["Ah", "Kh", "7d"], "board2": ["2s", "9c", "Qd"]}`
- **3-Board:** `{"board1": [...], "board2": [...], "board3": [...]}`

**3. `player_hands` (Private Cards)**

```sql
game_id: uuid
user_id: uuid
cards: jsonb -- ['As', 'Ks']
```

- **Indian Poker Logic:** For Indian Poker, you actually flip the RLS logic\! You need to see _everyone else's_ cards but not your own. You would write a policy that says "Allow select if `auth.uid() != user_id`".

### 4\. Step-by-Step: How Games Are Created & Played

Here is the workflow from a Next.js perspective:

#### Step 1: Creation

User clicks "Create Table".

1.  **Client:** Calls `supabase.from('tables').insert({ variant: 'double_board_plo', ... })`.
2.  **Server (Postgres):** Creates the table row.
3.  **Client:** Redirects user to `/table/[id]`.

#### Step 2: Joining & Subscribing

1.  **Client (`/table/[id]`):**

    ```javascript
    // Listen for public game updates (pot, board, turn)
    const gameSub = supabase
      .channel("public_game")
      .on(
        "postgres_changes",
        { event: "UPDATE", table: "games" },
        handleGameUpdate,
      )
      .subscribe();

    // Listen for MY cards (private)
    const handSub = supabase
      .channel("my_hand")
      .on(
        "postgres_changes",
        {
          event: "INSERT",
          table: "player_hands",
          filter: `user_id=eq.${myUserId}`,
        },
        handleNewCards,
      )
      .subscribe();
    ```

#### Step 3: Game Logic (The "Dealer")

You should **not** run game logic (determining who wins, dealing cards) on the client. If User A disconnects, the game stops.
Use **Supabase Edge Functions** or **Database Triggers**.

1.  **Action:** Player A clicks "Bet 100".
2.  **Client:** `supabase.from('actions').insert({ game_id: 1, amount: 100, type: 'bet' })`.
3.  **Database Trigger:**
    - Validates the bet (does player have enough chips?).
    - Updates `games` table (pot size increases).
    - Calculates next player.
    - Updates `games` table (current_player_id changes).
4.  **Realtime:** Sees the update to `games` table and broadcasts it to all clients. UI updates automatically.

### Summary

1.  **Use `jsonb` columns** for the board and cards to handle Double/Triple boards without changing the schema.
2.  **Use RLS** to strictly control which cards are sent to which player via Realtime.
3.  **Centralize Logic** in Postgres Functions or Edge Functions so the game state is authoritative and secure.
