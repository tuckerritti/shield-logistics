Brand Identity: Jadler in Japan

1. Core Philosophy

The Vibe: "Tokyo Noir meets Edwardian High-Stakes."
A fusion of old-world physical luxury (mahogany, felt) with modern, cinematic digital interfaces (glassmorphism, glowing typography). It feels like an exclusive, after-hours backroom in a cyberpunk metropolis where tradition meets degeneracy.

The Aesthetic: "Glass & Grain."
We do not choose between skeuomorphism and flat design; we blend them. Real wood and felt textures provide the foundation, while floating, blurred glass panels provide the interface.

4. UI Design Language

The "Glassmorphism" Standard

Player plaques and control panels must not look like solid plastic. They must look like frosted glass floating above the table.

CSS: background: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.4);

Filter: backdrop-filter: blur(8px);

Border: 1px solid rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1);

Lighting & Atmosphere

Vignette: The edges of the screen must always fade to black (#000). Focus is strictly on the table.

Glow: Active elements (winners, high-value pots) should utilize text-shadows to simulate luminescence.

Gold Glow: text-shadow: 0 0 12px rgba(212, 175, 55, 0.6);

Texture Strategy

Wood: Used only for structural boundaries (the table rail).

Felt: Used only for the play surface.

Glass: Used for all transient information (names, scores, buttons).

5. Tone of Voice

Persona: The Silent Pit Boss.
Style: Minimalist, Direct, slightly Ominous but Professional.

Correct: "The stakes are raised." / "Folded." / "JADLER IN JAPAN"

Incorrect: "You bet more money!" / "Game Over" / "Welcome to the game!"
